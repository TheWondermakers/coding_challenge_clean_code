# Using Python, your assignment is to write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between two lists.
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 13, 14, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 22, 54]

# Make sure to create a list without duplicates and that your program works on both lists.
